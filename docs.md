# AugmentedChords - User Guide

## What is AugmentedChords?

AugmentedChords is an app for your smartglasses that shows guitar chord progressions as you play. It displays chord measures right in your field of vision, so you can keep your hands on your instrument while seeing what chords to play next.

## Getting Started

1. Put on your AugmentOS-compatible smartglasses
2. Start the AugmentedChords app 
3. You'll see the welcome message "AugmentedChords App Ready!"
4. The default song will appear automatically

## Voice Commands

Simply speak these commands to control the app:

- **"Play [song name]"** - Loads chord progressions for any song
  - Example: "Play Dreams by Fleetwood Mac"
  - Example: "Play Wonderwall"

- **"Help"** - Shows available commands and navigation options

## Navigation Controls

You can move through the chord measures using these controls:

- **Footswitch** - Press to advance to the next measure
- **Right Arrow** - Advance to the next measure
- **Left Arrow** - Go back to the previous measure

## What You'll See on Screen

The display shows:
- Song title and artist at the top (e.g., "Dreams - Fleetwood Mac (1/10)")
- Up to 4 measures of chords at a time
- Measures are numbered for easy tracking

## Tips

- When you reach the end of a song, the app will show a "End of song - looping back" message
- The app will then return to the beginning of the song
- If you try to go before the first measure, you'll see a "Beginning of song" message
- Wait for song loading to complete after voice commands
- Inputs are temporarily ignored during loading and message displays
- **Important:** Wait for the "Searching for chords..." message before speaking another command - this prevents multiple browser windows from opening

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
- Try the "Help" voice command
- Make sure your smartglasses have a good internet connection
- Check that your AugmentOS software is up to date
- For developers: Check the console logs for detailed debugging information about chord lookup issues
